# MyFirstMicrogame
The objective of this game was to kill all of the slimes and make it to the end. To run this game, simply press start and jump on the slime to kill them. Making my first microgame in Unity was fun and a good learning experience. I made the character red and the slimes blue, which taught me how to change colors and materials in Unity. It was exciting to see my changes come to life in the game. Testing the changes made sure everything worked properly. I enjoyed customizing the game, even though I found some parts of Unity tricky at first. Overall, it was a great way to start learning game development.
